# krei

> write code that generates code, so you can write more code

`krei` is a project-as-code approach for project creation, diffing, and validation. Think of it like a programmable code- or project-generator. `krei` is just a small prototyp at the moment and thus **not recommended** for production projects.

## krei-core

Re-usable Java library which implements the core logic behind `krei`. See [here](krei-core) for details. (**proof of concept**)

## krei-metio

Definitions for projects at https://github.com/metio. See [here](krei-metio) for details. (**proof of concept**)
