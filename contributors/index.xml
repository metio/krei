Available Mirrors https://github.com/metio/krei https://repo.or.cz/krei.git https://codeberg.org/metio.wtf/krei https://gitlab.com/metio.wtf/krei https://bitbucket.org/metio-wtf/krei Automatic Mirroring The Gitlab repository pulls changes from GitHub and pushes changes into Codeberg and Bitbucket. The repo.or.cz mirror pulls from GitHub as well, therefore all you have to do is, push your changes into GitHub and a few minutes later, all other repositories will get the latest code automatically - including all branches.</description></item><item><title>IntelliJ Idea</title><link>https://krei.projects.metio.wtf/contributors/idea/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krei.projects.metio.wtf/contributors/idea/</guid><description>IntelliJ Idea is a popular IDE by Jetbrains. It allows several ways to share settings across team members in a project.
krei stores its IntelliJ settings inside its git repository and thus should work out-of-the-box for other IntelliJ users.
In case you have trouble getting krei to work in IntelliJ, take a look at the help section.</description></item><item><title>Makefile</title><link>https://krei.projects.metio.wtf/contributors/makefile/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krei.projects.metio.wtf/contributors/makefile/</guid><description>The Makefile commonly used task by maintainers of this project.
